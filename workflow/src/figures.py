Shared Rendering Library
========================

House style, panel layout and dual-artifact saving for cnsplots figures.
This is a library module (no main(), no CLI) per python-script-conventions.

Every uniform grid in the project goes through ``grid_axes``, which is the
cnsplots-documented matplotlib grid pattern: ``cns.figure()`` sizes the page,
``fig.subplots()`` allots equal GridSpec cells, ``set_box_aspect`` keeps them
square and ``tight_layout`` fits the decorations. Heterogeneous figures use
``cns.multipanel`` directly.

Sizing runs panel-first: titles, tick labels and axis labels are fixed at the
house font sizes, so legibility depends on the *axes* box, not the page. A
caller picks a ``PanelShape`` and the figure size follows from the grid, rather
than dividing a fixed page width by the column count and letting panels shrink
out of the legible range as the grid grows.
